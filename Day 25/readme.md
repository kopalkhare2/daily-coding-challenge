## ðŸŒ€ Problem 1: Rotate Array

### ðŸ”— Link:
[LeetCode 189: Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

### ðŸ§  Problem Summary:
Given an array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative

### ðŸ’¡ Optimal Approach: Reversal Algorithm

To rotate the array in-place with O(1) space:

#### ðŸ”¢ Steps:
1. Reverse the entire array.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements.
