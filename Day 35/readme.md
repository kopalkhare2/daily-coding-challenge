## ðŸ“˜ Problem 434: Number of Segments in a String

### Difficulty:
Easy

### Description:
Given a string `s`, return the **number of segments** in the string.

A **segment** is defined as a contiguous sequence of **non-space characters**.

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 300`
- `s` consists of:

## ðŸ“˜ Problem 236: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

### Difficulty:
Medium

### Description:
Given a binary tree, find the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition on Wikipedia:
> "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.
