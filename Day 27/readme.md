## ðŸ§  Approach & Method

### ðŸ”¹ Maximum Subarray
**Approach:**  
Kadane's Algorithm is used to track the current subarray sum. At each step, we decide whether to continue the existing subarray or start a new one from the current element. The maximum sum found during this process is the answer.

**Method Summary:**  
- Initialize `currentSum` and `maxSum` with the first element.
- Traverse the array:
  - At each step, choose the maximum between the current element and `currentSum + element`.
  - Update `maxSum` if `currentSum` exceeds it.

### ðŸ”¹ Path Sum
**Approach:**  
We use DFS recursion to check each root-to-leaf path in the binary tree. At each node, we subtract its value from the `targetSum` and recursively check its left and right children.

**Method Summary:**  
- If a node is a leaf and its value equals the remaining target, return true.
- Recursively call for left and right subtrees with updated `targetSum`.
- Return true if either subtree has a valid path.
